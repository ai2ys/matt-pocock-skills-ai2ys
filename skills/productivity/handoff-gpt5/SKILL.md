name: handoff-gpt5
description: Compact the current conversation into a handoff document for another agent to pick up. Codex/GPT variant.
argument-hint: "What will the next session be used for?"
---

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save to the temporary directory of the user's OS - not the current workspace.

Before writing, distinguish verified facts, completed actions, open assumptions, and recommended next steps. Do not collapse these into a single summary paragraph.

Optimise for continuation: preserve decision rationale, blockers, unresolved questions, and the smallest safe next action.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (PRDs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the document, which suggests skills that the agent should invoke.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
